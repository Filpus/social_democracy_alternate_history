= Building a People's Party

Contrary to orthodox Marxist predictions, the industrial proletariat is not constantly increasing in size. The rapid growth of the "new middle class" of white-collar workers and the persistence of small farmers and the peasantry confound predictions of a working-class majority.

In order to build a socialist majority, many liberalss and neorevisionists are calling for our party to move beyond the urban working class, to embrace the concerns of the middle class, farmers, and women of all classes. We can create a new and inclusive vision of the party that encompasses all people who work for a living, which is almost everyone in the country save the aristocrats and top capitalists.

- @support_peoples_party: Yes, we must become a people's party!
- @build_support: We must build additional support before becoming a people's party.
- @support_peoples_party_hard: Despite strong opposition from the Center and Left factions, we will become a people's party.
- @no_new_ideas: No, we will always be a party of the working class.
- @root: Perhaps we can discuss this at a later time.

on-arrival: peoples_party_support += 1; neorevisionist_strength += 5; progressives_strength -= 5; progressives_dissent += 5

Within our party, we are pushing forward proposals for a people's party against the Left and Center.

In an emergency conference, we have decided to become a people's party that encompasses all of the regular people of Germany, not just the workers and urban poor. The Left and Center claim that our new party platform is a betrayal of our founding principles, a turn away from Marxism towards bourgeois opportunism. Whatever the case, we are now a party representing all of the people, not just the proletariat.

Should we run a new campaign to publicize our new platform?

It is an arduous and contentious process, but we have pushed through the proposal to become a people's party. The Left and Center claim that our new party platform is a betrayal of our founding principles, a turn away from Marxism towards bourgeois opportunism. Whatever the case, we are now a party representing all of the people, not just the proletariat.

Should we run a new campaign to publicize our new platform?

@campaign_workers
title: Campaign among the workers, to assuage their doubts about our changes.
on-arrival: workers_ko += 6*(1-dissent);

The workers are still a key part of our constituency, and we must not alienate them in the transformation of our party.

@campaign_middle
title: Campaign among the middle classes.
on-arrival: entrepreneurs_ko += 5*(1-dissent); middle_class_ko += 6*(1-dissent)

As a people's party, we represent the employees and small businesspeople of the middle class, and they are becoming receptive to our messages.

@campaign_rural
title: Campaign in rural areas.
choose-if: rural_policy > 0
unavailable-subtitle: We have not enacted any rural policies yet.
on-arrival: rural_ko += 7*(1-dissent)

As a people's party, we represent farmers and rural workers as well, and they are becoming receptive to our messages.

@campaign_pensioners
title: Campaign among the pensioners.
on-arrival: pensioners_ko += 6*(1-dissent);

As a people's party, the urban poor are still a key part of our constituency.

@campaign_women
title: Campaign among women of all classes.
on-arrival: workers_ko += 3*(1-dissent); middle_class_ko += 3*(1-dissent); entrepreneurs_ko += 3*(1-dissent); rural_ko += 3*(1-dissent); pensioners_ko += 3*(1-dissent);

As a people's party, we represent women of all classes.

@campaign_youth
title: Campaign among political Catholics.
on-arrival: youth_ko += 7*(1-dissent);

Catholics have historically been tied to the Center Party, but there is no reason why our party cannot appeal to them. The Prussian Concordat in particular is a sign of our friendship with Catholicism.

on-arrival: neorevisionist_strength -= 6; neorevisionist_dissent += 5; pragmatists_strength += 8; progressives_strength += 3; peoples_party = 0; peoples_party_support -= 3

The Social Democrats have been and will always be a party of the working class.
